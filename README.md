# Speaker-Recognition-Using-Gaussian-Mixture-Models-GMMs-
This project develops a speaker recognition system using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The system extracts voice features to train models for identifying individual speakers, achieving high accuracy on the VoxForge dataset.
